Summary: 
This folder contains files for performing syntactical analysis on a scheme file.
The project will create a P2 file that outputs each grammar rule used in order to
determine if all tokens are in a syntactically correct order. Proj2 is completlely 
functional in regards to assembling a P2 file. There is a .lst file that is 
filled with each line of the scheme file, as well as any syntactical or lexical
errors that occured. The .lst file is correctly populated with errors in nearly
all instances.
